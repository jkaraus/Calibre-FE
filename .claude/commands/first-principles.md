# First Principles Analysis

**Problem**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Framework

### Step 1: What are we actually trying to achieve?

Strip away assumptions. What is the fundamental goal?

### Step 2: What are the absolute constraints?

Not "how it's usually done" but physical/logical limits:

- Technical constraints (what's actually impossible)
- Business constraints (actual requirements)
- Time/resource constraints (real limits)

### Step 3: What assumptions are we making?

List every assumption, then challenge each:

- Is this actually true?
- Is this how it HAS to be, or how it's usually done?
- What if this assumption were wrong?

### Step 4: What are the fundamental building blocks?

Break down to atomic components:

- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?
- What transformations are needed?

### Step 5: Rebuild from fundamentals

Now construct the solution from first principles:

- What's the simplest path from inputs to outputs?
- What's actually necessary vs nice-to-have?
- What would we build if starting from scratch?

## Output Format

```markdown
## First Principles Analysis: [Problem]

### Fundamental Goal

[What we actually need to achieve]

### Real Constraints

1. [Constraint that can't be changed]
2. [Another real limit]

### Challenged Assumptions

| Assumption   | Status   | Reasoning             |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| "We need X"  | ❌ False | Actually we need Y    |
| "Must use Z" | ✅ True  | Required for [reason] |

### Building Blocks

- Input: [What we start with]
- Output: [What we need]
- Core operation: [Fundamental transformation]

### First Principles Solution

[The approach derived from fundamentals]

### Comparison

| Aspect      | Conventional | First Principles |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Complexity  | High         | Lower            |
| Time        | X days       | Y days           |
| Maintenance | Hard         | Easier           |

### Recommendation
